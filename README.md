## `byteMentor WGU`

As a career advisor at Western Governors University, I developed a conversational chatbot to address the growing demand for career guidance among computer science students. With increasing enrollment, it became impossible to meet with each student individually, so I created the chatbot within a Pandorabots environment to provide scalable support. The bot was programmed with various job roles requiring a computer science undergraduate degree, offering students tailored career insights. To access the chatbot, users must create an account with Pandorabots.

## Steps to access the chatbot on Pandorabot

1. Visit the pandorabots sign in page link: [Access the Chatbot](https://www.pandorabots.com/)
2. Click "Sign In" if you have an account, or "Create Account" to register.
3. After signing in, select "DIRECTORY" from the menu on the left side.
4. Search for "byteMentor," click on it, and a orange chat icon will appear at the bottom right corner of the screen.
5. Answer career-related questions.
6. Receive job recommendations.
